									Abstract: As large-scale machine learning models become more prevalent
									in assistive and pervasive technologies, the research community
									has started examining limitations and challenges that arise from
									training data, e.g., fairness, bias, and interpretability issues. To
									this end, data-centric approaches are increasingly prevailing over
									time, showing that high-quality data is a critical component in
									many applications. Several studies explore methods to define and
									improve data quality, however, no uniform definition exists. In
									this work, we present an empirical analysis of the multifaceted
									problem of evaluating data quality. Our work aims at identifying
									data quality challenges that are most commonly observed by data
									users and practitioners. Inspired by the need for generally applicable
									methods, we select a representative set of quality indicators, that
									covers a broad spectrum of issues, and investigate the utility of these
									indicators on a broad range of datasets through inter-annotator
									agreement analysis. Our work provides insights and presents open
									challenges in designing improved data life cycles.

									Abstract: Expressing confidence is challenging for embodied agents navigating dynamic multimodal environments, where uncertainty arises from both perception and decision-making processes. We present the first work investigating embodied confidence elicitation in open-ended multimodal environments. We introduce Elicitation Policies,
									which structure confidence assessment across inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning, along with Execution Policies, which enhance confidence calibration through scenario reinterpretation, action sampling, and hypothetical reasoning. Evaluating agents in calibration and failure prediction tasks within the Minecraft environment, we show that structured reasoning approaches, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, improve
									confidence calibration. However, our findings also reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing uncertainty, particularly under abductive settings, underscoring the need for more sophisticated embodied confidence elicitation methods.

									Abstract: This thesis explores advanced techniques for improving machine learning models with a focus on developing well-calibrated and robust classifiers. We concentrated on two methods, Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) and Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing classification accuracy and reliability. Our research introduced a new mathematical approach to improve the stability and performance of Joint Energy Models (JEMs). By leveraging the generative capabilities of SVGD, the model is guided to learn better data representations, which are crucial for robust classification. Using the CIFAR-10 image dataset, we confirmed prior research indicating that SGLD, particularly when combined with an optimization method called Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), delivered the best results in terms of accuracy and stability. Notably, SVGD without SAM, despite yielding slightly lower classification accuracy, exhibited significantly lower calibration error, making it particularly valuable for safety-critical applications. However, SVGD required careful tuning of hyperparameters and substantial computational resources. This study lays the groundwork for future efforts to enhance the efficiency and reliability of these advanced sampling techniques, with the overarching goal of improving classifier calibration and robustness with JEMs.

										Abstract: A mechanical insect wing station has been constructed to understand the underlying fluid dynamic principles which guide the circulation of hemolymph in an insect wing. 
										The frequency at which the wing flaps depends on the voltage fed to the motor and on the inertial properties of the wing. Using machine learning (ML) to perform regression, 
										estimating the values of dependent variables based on independent variables, is a well-studied task both in academia and industry. While many generic regression models are available,
										we wanted to be able to calibrate the apparatus for new wings using only sparse data. A custom regression model was built using Tensorflow with the adaptive moment estimation algorithm 
										(Adam) as the optimization function and Huber as the loss function to learn the relationship between the voltage and frequency of specific insect wing models fabricated with stereolithography 
										resin printers. Datasets were prepared by manually tracking the flapping wing in video data in order to find the flapping frequency in Hertz and the voltage from the power source in Volts at 
										that frequency. The mean absolute percentage error is used to measure the accuracy of the prediction. The model predicts voltage based on input frequency with a 94% success rate. Automating 
										this manual task with an ML model improves the accuracy of values. This is essential to improve data accuracy in the insect wing hemodynamics experiments which has a broader application to 
										downstream tasks such as developing systems for drug delivery and other applications in human health.

										Abstract: Over 500 million people are affected by diabetes worldwide. For insulin-dependent patients, treatments include bulky and inconvenient battery-powered insulin pumps and painful syringe injections. 
										The InsulPatch is an alternative, smaller-scale insulin delivery pump currently under development. It provides an inexpensive way to administer insulin easily, painlessly, and without a power source,
										making insulin delivery more convenient for Type 1 diabetics. Inspired by the insect respiratory system, the InsulPatch features a multilayer microfluidic pump system. It uses the wearer’s radial pulse to 
										pump insulin transdermally via a microneedle array. Photolithography and stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing microfabrication techniques were used to create device design molds. The molds were then used 
										to create the InsulPatch device layers by pouring liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into the molds and baking to cure the PDMS. The devices contain three layers: a top layer consisting of actuation channels,
										a thin middle membrane, and a bottom layer containing the flow channels. Flow rate data was collected at different actuation pressures and frequencies for different flow and actuation channel geometric design 
										parameters. The devices were actuated using pressurized air signals representing different blood pressures and heart rates. The flow rate data was collected and analyzed using Graphpad Prism. This data was then
										used to create a sequential regression machine learning model with 80% prediction accuracy, enabling the solution of the inverse problem of producing device designs for specific patients. After successful clinical 
										trials, the InsulPatch will allow for accessible, painless, and convenient insulin delivery.
